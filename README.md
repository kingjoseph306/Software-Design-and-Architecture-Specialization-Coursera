 Software Design and Architecture Specialization Coursera -  [Alberta University](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html)

 This repo contains all my assignment work while going through Software Design and Architecture Specialization in Coursera.

About this Specialization
In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. You will learn how to express and document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation such as UML diagrams.

I want to give special thanks to [Kenny Wong](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/kennyw) the Instructor of this Specialization.

There are 4 Courses in this Specialization:

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design" target="_blank" >Object-Oriented Design</a></br>
This course takes Java beginners to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML).

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns" target="_blank" >Design Pattern</a></br>
This course extends object-oriented analysis and design by incorporating design patterns to create interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells.

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-architecture" target="_blank" >Software Architectur</a></br>
The way that software components — subroutines, classes, functions, etc. — are arranged, and the interactions between them, is called architecture. In this course you will study the ways these architectures are represented, both in UML and other visual tools. We will introduce the most common architectures, their qualities, and tradeoffs. We will talk about how architectures are evaluated, what makes a good architecture, and an architecture can be improved. We'll also talk about how the architecture touches on the process of software development.

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/service-oriented-architecture" target="_blank" >Service-Oriented Architecture</a></br>
Based on an understanding of architectural styles, you will review architectures for web applications, then explore the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in two approaches: Web Services (WS*) and Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture.
